This is a playground for launching Gaffer with KSonnet. The definition files
here can be used to create a Gaffer cluster configuration for Kubernetes.

The Makefile grabs jsonnet and ksonnet off of Github to compile the
definitions.

The structure is:

  wildfly.jsonnet         - Deployments and services for Wildfly / Gaffer
  			    REST API.
  accumulo.jsonnet        - Deployments and services for Accumulo.
  hadoop.jsonnet          - Deployments and services for Hadoop.
  zookeeper.jsonnet       - Deployments and services for ZK.

  everything.jsonnet      - Invokes the above, and outputs a single Kubernetes
                            configuration.

To use:

  make

creates the JSON form output, everything.json, and

  make everything.yaml

if you prefer YAML (which is converted from JSON using kubectl).

If you've got a Kubernetes cluster ready to apply the config to, then either...

  make apply

or
 
  kubectl apply -f everything.json
